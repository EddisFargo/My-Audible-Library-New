window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>High fantasy with a double-shot of self-reinvention.</b></p> <p>Worn out after decades of packing steel and raising hell, Viv, the orc barbarian, cashes out of the warrior’s life with one final score. A forgotten legend, a fabled artifact, and an unreasonable amount of hope lead her to the streets of Thune, where she plans to open the first coffee shop the city has ever seen.</p> <p>However, her dreams of a fresh start pulling shots instead of swinging swords are hardly a sure bet. Old frenemies and Thune’s shady underbelly may just upset her plans. To finally build something that will last, Viv will need some new partners, and a different kind of resolve.</p> <p>A hot cup of fantasy, slice-of-life with a dollop of romantic froth.</p>";
